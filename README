# ðŸ§° Dev Environment Setup & System Debloater for Debian-based Linux

This repository includes two powerful shell scripts to help you clean up and prepare your development system on Debian-based distributions (like Ubuntu, Linux Mint, etc.):

- `debloater.sh`: Removes unnecessary pre-installed apps and packages.
- `install_dev_tools.sh`: Installs essential tools such as Git, VS Code, Node.js (via fnm), and Postman â€” while cleaning up any existing versions first.

## ðŸš€ How to Use

### 1. Run the Debloater (Optional but Recommended)

This step removes bloatware and unwanted software from your system before setting up your dev tools.

```bash
chmod +x debloater.sh
sudo ./debloater.sh
